This is a tiny bash script that will display a random cowboy bebop ending credit message to your terminal. Just copy `cbbb.sh` to a directory of your choice and add the following to your .zshrc/profile. (Depending on your other customizations you may want to wrap in a function or add an echo before/after).

```
source /Users/your/path/here/cbbb.sh
echo $TODAYS_MSG 
```
